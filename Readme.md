# Embedded Sys Proj.

## Names 
Karina Gonzalez, Austin Storm    
   
## Design Overview
Our main goal in this project was to ensure a connection between the TM4C1294 Tiva C launchpad and the Adafruit 16x32 LED Matrix Panel.
    
## Hardware List
EK-TM4C1294XL ARM Cortex
Adafruit 16x32 LED Matrix
USB Connector (debugger)


## Software Description
Karina - PWM output set up for 3 pins
Austin- PWM data out and Matrix data in.

In the end we were unable to succeed in making a stable connection between the launchpad and the LED board.

## What Was Actually Learned
It may seem as though a project without actual success might be all for nought however I feel that I learned a lot throughout this project. I learned about the basic principles of how a matrix operates including but not limited to the latch pin, the clock pin, the output enable pin, the row selection pins as well as the color selection pins and how all of these different things combine into making a matrix instead of a square. Each piece is a way of dividing the surface into more managable parts. I also learned how to successfully implement a PWM via C code onto the launchpad. In addition to this I learned about project management on a more hands on level with time delegation, timelines, and workloads. All in all for a non functioning LED matrix I took a lot away from the experience.
