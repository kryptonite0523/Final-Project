# Embedded Sys Proj.

## Names 
Karina Gonzalez, Austin Storm    
   
## Design Overview
Our main goal in this project was to ensure a connection between the TM4C1294 Tiva C launchpad and the Adafruit 16x32 LED Matrix Panel.
    
## Hardware List
EK-TM4C1294XL ARM Cortex
Adafruit 16x32 LED Matrix
USB Connector (debugger)


## Software Description
Karina - PWM output set up for 3 pins
Austin- PWM data out and Matrix data in.

In the end we were unable to succeed in making a stable connection between the launchpad and the LED board.
